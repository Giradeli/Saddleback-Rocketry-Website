## Codebase Details

### Configuration Files

- **vite.config.ts**: Vite configuration with React and Node polyfills.
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration for the project.
- **eslint.config.js**: ESLint configuration for linting.

### Source Code

#### Components

Reusable UI components located in `src/components/`:

The `AppRoutes` component ensures seamless navigation and integrates with the application's context for dynamic behavior.

#### Pages

Page components located in `src/pages/`:

- **HomePage.tsx**: Landing page.
- **MembersPage.tsx**: Displays current team members.
- **OldMembersPage.tsx**: Archive of past team members.

- **ApplyPage.tsx**: Application form for joining the team.
- **DonationPage.tsx**: Donation instructions.

#### Layouts

Layout components located in `src/layouts/`:

- **BaseLayout.tsx**: Base layout with global styles.
- **PageLayout.tsx**: Layout for standard pages.
- **ErrorLayout.tsx**: Layout for error pages.

#### Themes

Theme configurations located in `src/themes/`:

- **saddleback.ts**: Custom Material-UI theme for the project.

#### Services

Utility functions and API integrations located in `src/services/`:

#### Types

TypeScript interfaces located in `src/types/`:

- **IArchivedMember.ts**: Interface for archived team members.
- **IProject.ts**: Interface for projects.
- **ISponsor.ts**: Interface for sponsors.
- **ITeam.ts**: Interface for teams.

### ESLint Integration

The project uses ESLint for maintaining code quality and enforcing coding standards. The ESLint configuration is defined in `eslint.config.js` and includes the following features:

- **JavaScript and TypeScript Support**: Configured to lint both `.js` and `.ts/.tsx` files.
- **React Hooks Rules**: Ensures proper usage of React hooks with the `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` plugin.
- **React Refresh Rules**: Warns about improper exports with the `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` plugin.
- **Globals**: Includes browser-specific global variables using the `globals` package.

### Key Rules

- React hooks rules are enabled to enforce best practices.
- Warnings are issued for improper component exports to ensure compatibility with React Refresh.

### Running ESLint

To run ESLint and check for issues, use the following command:

```bash
yarn lint
```

This will analyze the codebase and report any linting errors or warnings.

## Using VSCode and the Workspace

The Saddleback Rocketry project is optimized for development in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Below are some guidelines and tips for setting up and using the workspace effectively.

### Recommended Extensions

To enhance your development experience, install the following extensions:

- **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets** (`dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets`): Provides useful snippets for React and Redux development.
- **ESLint** (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`): Helps identify and fix linting issues in your code.
- **Prettier - Code formatter** (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`): Ensures consistent code formatting.
- **Prettier+ESLint** (`rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint`): Combines Prettier and ESLint for seamless formatting and linting.

These extensions are already recommended in the workspace settings. VSCode will prompt you to install them when you open the project.

### Launching the Debugger

The project includes a pre-configured VSCode launch task for debugging. Follow these steps to launch the debugger:

1. Open the "Run and Debug" panel in VSCode (shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+D`).
2. Select the "Launch Chrome" configuration from the dropdown menu.
3. Press the green play button or `F5` to start debugging.

This will:

- Start the development server using the `yarn dev` task.
- Launch Google Chrome and open the application at `http://localhost:5173`.
- Attach the debugger to the Chrome instance for live debugging.

Ensure that the development server is not already running before starting the debugger to avoid conflicts.
